# SiLA2 Base Feature Definitions explorer

# Setup and build

1. Install node in your system. There are plenty of resources online about that.
2. Go to `tools/fdl_html_presentation`
3. Install `npm install` or if you prefer yarn: `yarn install`
4. Build `npm build` or `yarn build`
5. A new `build` folder has appeared. Here you can try your new web app

## Roadmap

1. Get the list of features from gitLab API: [Recursive tree list call](https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/5508183/repository/tree?recursive=1)
